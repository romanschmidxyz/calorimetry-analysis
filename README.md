# Calorimetry Analysis
This program creates a T-t calorimetry plot and calculates Delta T_X, the temperature rise upon sample
combustion using the equal areas method and extrapolated pre- and post-period curves.

## Instructions for use
- Insert your file name as follows in the code:
  with open('your_file_name.csv') as file:
- adjust the title according to your sample:
  plt.title("T-t Diagram Your Sample")
- adjust upper and lower thresholds if necessary to get the desired boundaries for the rise period.

## Output
DeltaT_x =  2.6679311422422565
